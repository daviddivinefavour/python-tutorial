# Coding With Python.
> Note: This is a compilation of multiple resources from well known organisations on the web(e.g. W3Schools).

Python as a programming language was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. And it is a m=very versatile programming language as it can be used for many various purposes, such as: server-side web development, software development, mathematics, etc.

## What can Python Do?
* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Python(PY) Vs Javascript(JS)
<table>
     <tr>
          <th>Python</th>
          <th>Javascript</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Python uses new lines to complete a command</td>
          <td>Javascript uses a semi-colon</td>
     <tr>
     </tr>
          <td>Python relies on indentation and a colon, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.</td>
          <td>Javascript uses a curly braces</td>
     </tr>
     </tr>
          <td>Python uses '#' for inline comments, it does not neccessary have a syntax for multiple line comments, but multiline strings(triple quotes) can be used as python would ignore all string literals not assigned or used.</td>
          <td>Javascript inline comment "//", while multiple line comment "/* multiple lines of comment */"</td>
     </tr>
     </tr>
          <td>Python does not have a syntax for declaring variables.</td>
          <td>Variables could be declared in javascrit using the keywords: var, let, const.</td>
     </tr>
     </tr>
          <td>Python conventionally uses Snake Case as its naming technique(e.g. my_var="something") </td>
          <td>Javascript on the other hand conventionally uses Camel Case as its naming technique(e.g. myVar="something") </td>
     </tr>
</table>
Just as anything can have differences, there would definitely be some similarities. In this same reasoning, some of the similarities of JS and PY includes;
* Both are dynamically-typed, meaning the language uses inference to know what type each identify value holds.
* Both are case-sensitive. 

## Datatypes and Variables 
Just as every other programming language out there, variables and datatypes are essential for carrying out the various logic and arithmetic operations intended. So, the availability and usuability of variables and datatypes in python is a must have.

### Variables 
This is a name of a memory location where some program data could be stored for accessiblity during program execution. The conventional rules to creating/naming variables still apply in python. 
> Recall that, in python variables do not require any initial declaration, therefore;
> my_first_var = 27

### Datatypes
The datatypes are the various types that any data value being expected **must** be categorized under. Py uses built-in datatypes, which includes;

     <tr>
          <th>Category</th>
          <th>Types</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Text Types</td>
          <td>str</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Numeric Types</td>
          <td>int, float, complex</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Sequence Types</td>
          <td>list, tuple, range</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Mapping Types</td>
          <td>dict</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Set Types</td>
          <td>set, frozenset</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Binary Types</td>
          <td>bytes, bytearray, memoryview</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Boolean Type</td>
          <td>bool</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>Boolean Type</td>
          <td>bool</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
          <td>None Type</td>
          <td>NoneType</td>
     </tr>
